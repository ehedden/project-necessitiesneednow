# Necessities Needed Now

Project Summary: Due to the current coronavirus pandemic, many people are panicking and as a result many have been stocking 
up on necessities â€” groceries, toiletries, etc. As a result, less able people like the elderly are troubled not only because 
of the lack of supplies, but also because they are more at risk when they go outside. For our final project, we want to build
a platform targeted at the elderly to help them shop for their necessities and lessen their burden during this pandemic.

We have incorporated the following user stories as of Iteration One (4/6/20):
* As a user, I can see what items, by name, are in my shopping cart.
* As a user, I will expect the program to store user information such as address and email for ease of saving preferences.
* As a user, I can add what necessities I need by typing it into the command line (by prompting for name and quantity)
* As a user, I want to be able to remove necessities from my shopping cart, either completely or just by an item or two.

```
NOTE FOR WHOEVER CONTINUES TYPING HERE: as of 4:15ish, the following user stories (from the "in-progress tab on github) 
that I have not put in this finished category due to me not knowing if it's 100% yet are: 
* As a user, I want to have a UI that is easy to use.
* As a user, I will be able to use a categorization system for items for ease of finding what I want.
* As a user, I want my information and preferences saved/loaded as CSV files in a file management system.
```

We have a few user stories that we plan to incorporate into the project in the near future:
* As a user, the program I'm using can check if an item I want to add is available or not.
    * We have not incorporated this because it would require the use of a functioning API from which we could draw upon
    to get this information. We do have an API in mind at this point in time.
* As a user, I can see what items are in my shopping cart, along with a little blurb that describes them.
    * Again, not having the API plays into why we don't have this user story incorporated quite yet. We plan to use this
    feature to give the customer a better idea of what they're purchasing: for example, using existing product descriptions
    that are taken from the API so that the user can make better, more informed decisions depending on their preferences.

``` 
Another note! The piazza post does mentions if we have any user stories we intend to complete by next iteration, and 
any user stories that we've implemented that doesn't work. It also asks for what commands are required to compile and 
run the code from the command line.

Maybe put at the end what we plan to have the scope of our project be? idk lol
